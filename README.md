designed according to the requirement and needs of the current market Rather than that, this system
also has been tested and evaluated in real life. This ORGAN TRANSPLANT MANAGEMENT
SYSTEM will help to improve the performance of current situation and overcome the problems that
arise,,nowdays

as administrator, doctor, medical assistant and management staff. Only administrator has the
authority and privileges to print organ list report and total donation report according to district
